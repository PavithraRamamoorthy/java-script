//Practice:

1. You have declared but you didn't assign any value. What happens when you print out this variable?
        var person; -> undefined

2. Declare variables with numbers, special chars at the start. Do you get any errors ?
        var number = $5; -> $5 is not defined

3. Declare and define a variable that stores your name. Using that variable, construct a new variable
that represents a greeting by concatenating "Hello" in front of your name       

        var x = "pavithra";
        var y = "Hello";
        console.log(y+x)
                Ans: Hellopavithra

4. We've seen that variables can store strings and numbers. We've also seen that when we have two
strings the +operator means concatenation, whereas when we have two number variables it
represents addition. What happens when we mix and match number and string variables? Give it a try.

        var tweet = "hello world!";
        var count = 0;

        count = count + 10;
        tweet = tweet + count;

        // what is the value of tweet and count now?
                Ans: 
                    tweet = hello world!10
                    count = 10
        
        count = count * 10;
        tweet = count + tweet;

        // what is the value of tweet and count now?
                Ans: 
                     tweet = 100hello world!10
                     count = 100
        
        count = count * 100;
        tweet = tweet + ". this is another sentence.";
        
        // what is the value of tweet and count now?
                Ans:
                    tweet = "100hello world!10. this is another sentence."
                    count = 10000



1.1. Using the Chrome JavaScript console, practice with the typeof operator. 
What are the types of the following values? 

        typeof true;     -> "boolean"
        typeof "true";   -> "string"
        typeof 1;        -> "number"
        typeof "1";      -> "string"
        typeof "one";    -> "string"


1.2. Using the Chrome JavaScript console, practice with string methods. 
If you type a string and then the dot operator, and then wait a moment, 
you'll see that Chrome's auto-complete box will appear. 
You can use the up and down arrows to cycle through all the methods available on the string object. 
Apply a few of those methods and see if you can understand what they do. 

        var person = "pavithra";
        person.length
        8
        
        person.bold()
        "<b>pavithra</b>"
        
        person.big()
        "<big>pavithra</big>"
        
        person.anchor()
        "<a name="undefined">pavithra</a>"
        
        person.charAt(3)
        "i"
        
        person.concat(" Ramamoorthy")
        "pavithra Ramamoorthy"

        person.endsWith("")
        true
        
        person.fixed()
        "<tt>pavithra</tt>"
        
        person.fontcolor("blue")
        "<font color="blue">pavithra</font>"
        
        person.fontsize(18)
        "<font size="18">pavithra</font>"
        
        person.includes("pavi")
        true
        
        person.includes("pavi")
        true
        
        person.toLocaleLowerCase()
        "pavithra"
        
        person.toLocaleUpperCase()
        "PAVITHRA"
        
        person.valueOf()
        "pavithra"
